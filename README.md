# Form object examples

This is a kind of “personal finances” **Demo app**, to keep track of transactions in bank accounts.

I have build this app as an example of using "form objects".

It uses to form objects [Transfer](https://github.com/bhserna/form_object_example/blob/main/app/models/transfer.rb) and [Expense](https://github.com/bhserna/form_object_example/blob/main/app/models/expense.rb)

I have a blog post explaining how the `Transfer` object, is used to create more than one record using a single form.

You can find the blog post on: [Using a form object to create more than one record](https://bhserna.com/you-can-create-a-model-for-that-multi-record-form.html)

And you can find a video to see how the tranfer works on: [Form object example - Transfer](https://www.loom.com/share/13ef2cc1fd674648b44cc3d57c0c5037)
